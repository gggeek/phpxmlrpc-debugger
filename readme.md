PHPXMLRPC Combo package
=======================

pulls together the xmlrpc server, jsonrpc server and the extras server in a single 'combo' server.
Also makes available a 'combo' debugger.

NB: to get the 'demo' files from the dependencies, needed to get full server functionality, use `--prefer-source` when installing.
